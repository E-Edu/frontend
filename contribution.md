# E-Edu Frontend Conventions

# Coding Style
- In general our variables and comments are in english.
- If one function is not self-explanatory, comment it.
- Name your variables in camelCase.
- Name your typescript classes in PascalCase.
- Name your css classes in kebab-case.
- Do not use id in html/ css.
- Use own components e.g. Button/ InputText.

If your code doesn't fit to these rules, we won't merge it until everything is correct!

# Git
## Issues
We use issues for everything. If you want to add something, create an issue. If you want to fix something, create an issue. And if you want to improve something, you should also create an issue.
## Branches
Name your branch after the related issue: ```issue/ISSUE-ID ISSUE-TITLE```
The experimental branch is our default branch. If you want to add or fix something use this branch to create your own branch.
## Pull Requests
Do not create a pull request to the master branch, instead create it to the experimental brach.
